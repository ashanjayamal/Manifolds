A set \\(X\\) with a topology \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is called a topological space. Denoted by \\((X,\\mathcal{T})\\). An element of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is called an open set. Definition 1.2 A subset \\(U \\subset M\\) is referred to as open in \\(M\\) if \\(U \\in \\mathcal{T}\\). A subset \\(A \\subset M\\) is termed closed if \\(M \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal{T}\\). Definition 1.3 (Continuity) If both \\((M, \\mathcal{T}_M)\\) and \\((N, \\mathcal{T}_N)\\) are topological spaces, a map \\(f : M \\rightarrow N\\) is termed continuous if \\[f^{-1}(V) \\in \\mathcal{T}_M \\text{ for all } V \\in \\mathcal{T}_N\\]. In other words, the preimages of open sets must be open. Definition 1.4 (Homemorphism) A map \\(f : M \\rightarrow N\\) between two topological spaces is called homemorphism if it has following propoties. - \\(f\\) is a bijection, - \\(f\\) is continuous, - the inverse function \\(f^{-1}\\) is continuous. Two topological spaces \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are called homeomorphic if there exists a homeomorphism between them. Definition 1.5 (Hausdorff Space) A topological space \\((X,\\mathcal{T})\\) is called a Hausdorff space if (H1) \\(\\forall x,y \\in X\\) such that \\(x \\neq y\\), \\(\\exists U_x, U_y \\in \\mathcal{T}\\) such that \\(x \\in U_x\\), \\(y \\in U_y\\), and \\(U_x \\cap U_y = \\emptyset\\). i.e., for every pair of distinct points \\(x, y\\) in \\(X\\), there are disjoint neighborhoods \\(U_x\\) and \\(U_y\\) of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) respectively. Figure 1.1: \\(~\\) Definition 1.6 (Countability) A space \\(X\\) is said to have a countable basis at the point \\(x\\) if there is a countable collection \\(\\{U_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+}\\) of neighborhoods of \\(x\\) such that any neighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(x\\) contains at least one of the sets \\(U_n\\). A space \\(X\\) that has a countable basis at each of its points is said to satisfy the first countability axiom.
