[["manifolds.html", "Chapter 2 Manifolds 2.1 Topological Manifolds", " Chapter 2 Manifolds 2.1 Topological Manifolds Definition 2.1 Let \\((M,\\mathcal{T})\\) be a topological space with topology \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Then \\(M\\) is called an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold, if the following holds: (TM1): \\(M\\) is Hausdorff. (TM2): The topology of \\(M\\) has a countable basis. (TM3): \\(M\\) is locally homeomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), that is, for all \\(p \\in M\\) exists an open subset \\(U \\subset M\\) with \\(p \\in U\\), an open subset \\(V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and a homeomorphism \\(\\varphi : U \\rightarrow V\\). Figure 2.1: \\(~\\) Remark. The first two conditions in the definition 2.1 are more of a technical nature and are sometimes neglected. The important fact is that a topological manifold is locally homeomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Loosely speaking, manifolds look locally like Euclidean space. If the topology on \\(M\\) is induced by a metric, then the first condition is satisfied automatically. If \\(M\\) is given as a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^N\\) with the subset topology, then both conditions M1 and M2 are satisfied automatically. Let’s see some examples. Example 2.1 Euclidean space \\(M=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) itself is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold: (TM1): We know that \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is metrc space. Let’s say the metric as \\(d\\). Let \\(x,y\\in \\mathcal{R}^n\\) with \\(x\\neq y\\). Let \\(r=d(x,y)\\). Since \\(x\\neq y\\),\\(r&gt;0\\). Let \\(U_x=B(x,r/2)\\) and \\(U_y=B(y,r/2)\\). So, \\(x\\in U_x\\) and \\(y\\in U_y\\) We need to show that \\(U_x \\cap U_y\\neq \\emptyset\\). We are going to proof by contrdiction. So, asssume the contray, there exist \\(z\\in U_x\\cap U_y\\). Thus, \\(d(x,z)&lt;r/2\\) and \\(d(y,z)&lt;r/2\\). Then, \\[r=d(x,y)\\leq d(x,z)+d(z,y)=d(x,z)+d(y,z)&lt;\\frac{r}{2}+\\frac{r}{2}=r\\] This is contradiction. Hence \\(U_x\\cap U_y \\neq \\emptyset\\). Therefore \\(M=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is Hausdorff. (TM2): (i), (ii) Obvious. Holds true with U = M, V = R n and x = id.
