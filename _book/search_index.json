Then \\(M\\) is called an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold, if the following holds: (TM1): \\(M\\) is Hausdorff. (TM2): The topology of \\(M\\) has a countable basis. (TM3): \\(M\\) is locally homeomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), that is, for all \\(p \\in M\\) exists an open subset \\(U \\subset M\\) with \\(p \\in U\\), an open subset \\(V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and a homeomorphism \\(\\varphi : U \\rightarrow V\\). Figure 2.1: \\(~\\) Remark. The first two conditions in the definition 2.1 are more of a technical nature and are sometimes neglected. The important fact is that a topological manifold is locally homeomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Loosely speaking, manifolds look locally like Euclidean space. If the topology on \\(M\\) is induced by a metric, then the first condition is satisfied automatically. If \\(M\\) is given as a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^N\\) with the subset topology, then both conditions M1 and M2 are satisfied automatically. Let’s see some examples. Example 2.1 Euclidean space \\(M=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) itself is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold: (TM1): We know that \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is metrc space. Let’s say the metric as \\(d\\). Let \\(x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) with \\(x\\neq y\\). Let \\(r=d(x,y)\\). Since \\(x\\neq y\\),\\(r&gt;0\\). Let \\(U_x=B(x,r/2)\\) and \\(U_y=B(y,r/2)\\). So, \\(x\\in U_x\\) and \\(y\\in U_y\\) We need to show that \\(U_x \\cap U_y\\neq \\emptyset\\). We are going to proof by contrdiction. So, asssume the contray, there exist \\(z\\in U_x\\cap U_y\\). Thus, \\(d(x,z)&lt;r/2\\) and \\(d(y,z)&lt;r/2\\). Then, \\[r=d(x,y)\\leq d(x,z)+d(z,y)=d(x,z)+d(y,z)&lt;\\frac{r}{2}+\\frac{r}{2}=r\\] This is contradiction. Hence \\(U_x\\cap U_y \\neq \\emptyset\\). Therefore \\(M=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is Hausdorff. (TM2): Later I will update this part Problem :(. (TM3): Let \\(U=\\mathbb{R}^n=M\\) and \\(V=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(\\varphi=id\\). We can easily tell that idenntity map is bijective. Furthur, we can observe that inverse of identity map is itself and it is well defined. So, Let \\(U&#39;\\subset U=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) be an open set \\[\\forall x\\in U&#39;\\quad id^{-1}(x)=id(x)=x\\]. Thus, \\[id(U&#39;)=id^{-1}(U&#39;)=U&#39;.\\] Hence, by definition of continuous mapping, \\(id\\) and \\(id^{-}\\) are continuous. Example 2.2 Let \\(M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) be an open subset. Then \\(M\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold. (TM1), (TM2) Obvious. (TM3) Holds true with \\(U = M\\), \\(V = M\\) and \\(x = \\text{id}\\). Here Ia m not going to proove this. It is very similar to first example. Example 2.3 The standard sphere \\(M = S^n = \\{ \\underline{y}=(y^0,...,y^{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : ||\\underline{y}|| = 1 \\}\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold. (TM1) and (TM2) , since \\(S^n\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\). (TM3) We construct two homeomorphisms with the help of the stereographic projection. Let \\(N\\) be north pole of the n-sphere, that is \\((\\underbrace{0,...,0}_{n~times},1)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\). Let \\(U_1:=S^n\\setminus \\{N\\}\\) and \\(v_1=\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\). We define \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\varphi:U_1&amp;\\to &amp; V_1\\\\ \\underline{y} =(y^0,y^1,...,y^n) &amp; \\mapsto &amp; \\frac{(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)}{1-y^{n+1}} \\end{eqnarray}\\] - Cliam 1: \\(varphi\\) is injective. Let \\((x^0,...,x^{n}),(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Suppose that \\(\\varphi(x^0,...,x^{n})=\\varphi(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)\\). \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\varphi(x^0,...,x^{n})&amp;=&amp;\\varphi(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)\\\\ \\frac{(x^0,x^1,...,x^n)}{1-x^{n+1}}&amp;=&amp;\\frac{(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)}{1-y^{n+1}}\\\\ (y^0, y^1, ..., y^n)(1-x^{n+1}) &amp;=&amp; (x^0, x^1, ..., x^n)(1-y^{n+1})\\\\ (y^0 - y^0x^{n+1}, y^1 - y^1x^{n+1}, ..., y^n - y^nx^{n+1}) &amp;=&amp; (x^0 - x^0y^{n+1}, x^1 - x^1y^{n+1}, ..., x^n - x^ny^{n+1})\\\\ y^0(1 - x^{n+1}), y^1(1 - x^{n+1}), ..., y^n (1- y^nx^{n+1}) &amp;=&amp; x^0(1-y^{n+1}), x^1(1 - y^{n+1}), ..., x^n (1- y^{n+1})\\\\ \\end{eqnarray}\\] Thus, \\(y^i(1 - x^{n+1}) = x^i(1 -y^{n+1})\\) for all \\(i = 0, 1, ..., n\\). Since \\(1 - y^{n+1}, 1 - x^{n+1} &gt; 0\\), ? ? ? ? Problem HOW INJECTIVITY COMES:(. CHECK:(. - Claim 2: \\(\\varphi\\) is surejctive.  Surjectivity means that for every \\(\\underline{v} \\in V_1 = \\mathbb{R}^n\\), there exists some \\(\\underline{y} \\in U_1\\) such that \\(\\varphi(\\underline{y}) = \\underline{v}\\). So, let \\(\\underline{v} = (v^0, v^1, ..., v^n) \\in V_1\\). We need to find \\(\\underline{y} = (y^0, y^1, ..., y^n) \\in U_1\\) such that \\[\\frac{(y^0, y^1, ..., y^n)}{1-y^{n+1}} = \\underline{v}.\\] We can solve this equation for \\(\\underline{y}\\) as follows: \\[\\underline{y} = (1-y^{n+1})\\underline{v} = \\underline{v} - y^{n+1}\\underline{v}.\\] We know that \\(\\underline{y} \\in U_1 = S^n \\setminus \\{N\\}\\), so \\(y^{n+1} = 1 - \\|\\underline{y}\\|^2\\). Substituting this into the equation gives us \\[\\underline{y} = \\underline{v} - (1 - \\|\\underline{y}\\|^2)\\underline{v} = \\|\\underline{y}\\|^2\\underline{v}.\\] Solving this equation for \\(\\|\\underline{y}\\|^2\\) gives us \\[\\|\\underline{y}\\|^2 = \\frac{\\|\\underline{v}\\|^2}{1 + \\|\\underline{v}\\|^2}.\\] Substituting this back into the equation for \\(\\underline{y}\\) gives us \\[\\underline{y} = \\frac{\\underline{v}}{1 + \\|\\underline{v}\\|^2}.\\] This is a well-defined point in \\(U_1\\) for every \\(\\underline{v} \\in V_1\\), so \\(\\varphi\\) is surjective. Claim: \\(\\varphi\\) is continuous. Note that the inverse map \\(\\phi\\) is given by, \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\phi : V_1 &amp;\\rightarrow &amp; U_1\\\\ \\underline{x}= (x^0, x^1, ... , x^n) &amp;\\mapsto &amp; \\frac{(x^0,x^1,...,x^{n-1})}{1 + x^n} \\end{eqnarray}\\] I will update this proof. I want some to to write rigirs proof:(. Analogously, we define the homeomorphism, which omits the south pole: Let now \\(U_2 := S^n \\setminus \\{S\\}\\) with \\(S := ( 0,... , 0, -1) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\) and \\(V_2 := \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\varphi : U_2 &amp;\\rightarrow &amp; V_2,\\\\ \\underline{y}= (y^0, y^1, ... , y^n) &amp;\\mapsto &amp; \\frac{(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)}{1 + y^n} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Therefore, \\(n\\)-sphere \\(S^n\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold. Example 2.4 (Non-Example) We consider \\(M := \\{ (y^1, y^2, y^3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 | (y^1)^2 = (y^2)^2 + (y^3)^2 \\}\\), the double cone. Since \\(M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3\\), both (i) and (ii) are satisfied. But \\(M\\) is not a 2-dimensional manifold. Assume it were, then there would exist an open subset \\(U \\subset M\\) with \\(0 \\in U\\), an open subset \\(V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2\\) and a homeomorphism \\(\\varphi : U \\rightarrow V\\) with \\(\\varphi(0) = 0\\). How do we Gruntee that such hormouphsim exsist that maps 0 to 0:( Without losss of generality assume \\(V = B_r(x(0))\\) with \\(r &gt; 0\\). Choose \\((p^1,p^2,p^3), (q^1,q^2,q^3) \\in U\\) with \\(p^1 &gt; 0\\) and \\(q^1 &lt; 0\\). Furthermore, choose a continuous path \\(c : [0, 1] \\rightarrow V\\) with \\(c(0) = x(q_1)\\), \\(c(1) = x(q_2)\\) and \\(c(t) \\neq x(0)\\) for all \\(t \\in [0, 1]\\). Define the continuous path \\(\\tilde{c} := x^{-1} \\circ c : [0, 1] \\rightarrow U\\). Then \\(\\tilde{c}(0) = q_1\\), \\(\\tilde{c}(1) = q_2\\), that is, we have \\(\\tilde{c}_1(0) &gt; 0\\) while \\(\\tilde{c}_1(1) &lt; 0\\). Applying the mean value theorem we find, that there exists a \\(t \\in (0, 1)\\) with \\(\\tilde{c}_1(t) = 0\\). Then \\(\\tilde{c}(t) = (0, 0, 0)\\) and consequently \\(c(t) = x(\\tilde{c}(t)) = x(0)\\), which contradicts the choice of \\(c\\). Hence, \\(M\\) is not a 2-dimensional topological manifold. Definition 2.2 (charts) If \\(M\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold, the homeomorphisms \\(\\varphi : U \\to V\\) are called charts (or local coordinate systems) of \\(M\\). Figure 2.2: \\(~\\) After choosing a local coordinate system \\(\\varphi : U \\rightarrow V\\) every point \\(p \\in U\\) is uniquely characterized by its coordinates \\((\\varphi^1(p), \\ldots , \\varphi^n(p))\\). Example 2.5 (0-dimesional manifold) In a \\(0\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) every point \\(p \\in M\\) has an open neighborhood \\(U\\), which is homeomorphic to \\(R^0 = \\{0\\}\\). Consequently \\(\\{p\\} = U\\) is an open subset of \\(M\\) for all \\(p \\in M\\), that is, \\(M\\) carries the discrete topology. Since there exists a countable basis for the topology on \\(M\\) and the topology is discrete in addition, \\(M\\) has to be countable itself. Figure 2.3: \\(~\\) Proposition 2.1 A topological space \\(M\\) is a 0-dimensional topological manifold, if and only if \\(M\\) is countable and carries the discrete topology. Proof. (\\(\\implies\\)) By definition, a 0-dimensional topological manifold is a topological space where every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the 0-dimensional Euclidean space, which is a single point \\(\\{0\\}\\). This implies that for every point \\(p \\in M\\), there exists an open neighborhood \\(U\\) such that \\(\\{p\\} = U\\). This is exactly the definition of a discrete topology. Since, there exists a countable basis for the topology on \\(M\\), and every point in \\(M\\) is an open set (i.e., the topology is discrete), then \\(M\\) must be countable. This is because every point in \\(M\\) corresponds to an open set in the basis, and since the basis is countable, \\(M\\) must also be countable. (\\(\\Longleftarrow\\)) If \\(M\\) carries the discrete topology, then every subset of \\(M\\) is open. In particular, for every point \\(p \\in M\\), the set \\(\\{p\\}\\) is an open set. This means that every point in \\(M\\) has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the 0-dimensional Euclidean space, which is a single point \\(\\{0\\}\\). This is exactly the definition of a 0-dimensional topological manifold. If \\(M\\) is countable, then there exists a countable basis for the topology on \\(M\\). Since every point in \\(M\\) is an open set (i.e., the topology is discrete), this basis can be taken to be the set of all singletons \\(\\{p\\}\\), where \\(p \\in M\\). Therefore, a topological space \\(M\\) is a 0-dimensional topological manifold if and only if \\(M\\) is countable and carries the discrete topology. Definition 2.3 A topological manifold \\(M\\) is said to be connected, if for every two points \\(p, q \\in M\\) there exists a continuous map \\(c : [0, 1] \\to M\\) with \\(c(0) = p\\) and \\(c(1) = q\\). Figure 2.4: \\(~\\) Given two points, there has to be a continuous curve in \\(M\\) which connects both. Usually, in Topology one calls this path-connected, which is in the case of manifolds equivalent to being connected. We do not want to go deeper into this subject at this point.
