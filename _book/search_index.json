A set \\(X\\) with a topology \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is called a topological space. Denoted by \\((X,\\mathcal{T})\\). An element of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is called an open set. Definition 1.2 A subset \\(U \\subset M\\) is referred to as open in \\(M\\) if \\(U \\in \\mathcal{T}\\). A subset \\(A \\subset M\\) is termed closed if \\(M \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal{T}\\). Definition 1.3 (Continuity) If both \\((M, \\mathcal{T}_M)\\) and \\((N, \\mathcal{T}_N)\\) are topological spaces, a map \\(f : M \\rightarrow N\\) is termed continuous if \\[f^{-1}(V) \\in \\mathcal{T}_M \\text{ for all } V \\in \\mathcal{T}_N\\]. In other words, the preimages of open sets must be open. Definition 1.4 (Homemorphism) A map \\(f : M \\rightarrow N\\) between two topological spaces is called homemorphism if it has following propoties. - \\(f\\) is a bijection, - \\(f\\) is continuous, - the inverse function \\(f^{-1}\\) is continuous. Two topological spaces \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are called homeomorphic if there exists a homeomorphism between them. Definition 1.5 (Hausdorff Space) A topological space \\((X,\\mathcal{T})\\) is called a Hausdorff space if (H1) \\(\\forall x,y \\in X\\) such that \\(x \\neq y\\), \\(\\exists U_x, U_y \\in \\mathcal{T}\\) such that \\(x \\in U_x\\), \\(y \\in U_y\\), and \\(U_x \\cap U_y = \\emptyset\\). i.e., for every pair of distinct points \\(x, y\\) in \\(X\\), there are disjoint neighborhoods \\(U_x\\) and \\(U_y\\) of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) respectively. Figure 1.1: \\(~\\) Definition 1.6 (Countability) A space \\(X\\) is said to have a countable basis at the point \\(x\\) if there is a countable collection \\(\\{U_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+}\\) of neighborhoods of \\(x\\) such that any neighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(x\\) contains at least one of the sets \\(U_n\\). A space \\(X\\) that has a countable basis at each of its points is said to satisfy the first countability axiom. 1.0.1 Stereographic Projection Stereographic Projection plane \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the 1-sphere minus a point The 1-sphere \\(S^1\\) is the set of points \\((x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\) such that \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\\). \\[S^1:=\\{(x,y): ||(x,y)||=1\\}\\] Let \\(S^1 \\setminus \\{N\\}\\) denote the 1-sphere minus (circle) its north pole, i.e., the point \\((0,1)\\). There exists a homeomorphism \\(\\varphi : S^1 \\setminus \\{N\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\), which can be described as follows. In coordinates, this map is precisely \\[\\varphi(x,y) = \\frac{x}{1-y}\\] Figure 1.2: \\(~\\) Stereographic Projection plane \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) and the 2-sphere minus a point Stereographic projection is an important homeomorphism between the plane \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) and the 2-sphere minus a point. The 2-sphere \\(S^2\\) is the set of points \\((x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\) such that \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\\). Let \\(S^2 \\setminus \\{N\\}\\) denote the 2-sphere minus its north pole, i.e., the point \\((0,0,1)\\). There exists a homeomorphism \\(\\varphi : S^2 \\setminus \\{N\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\), which can be described as follows. For a point \\(p \\in S^2 \\setminus \\{N\\}\\), let \\(\\varphi(p)\\) denote the unique point in \\(P\\) such that the intersection of the segment \\(\\overline{Nf(p)}\\) and \\(S^2\\) is \\(p\\). In coordinates, this map is precisely \\[\\varphi(x,y,z) = \\left(\\frac{x}{1-z}, \\frac{y}{1-z}\\right).\\] Figure 1.3: \\(~\\) Figure 1.4: \\(~\\) "],["manifolds.html", "Chapter 2 Manifolds 2.1 Topological Manifolds", " Chapter 2 Manifolds 2.1 Topological Manifolds Definition 2.1 Let \\((M,\\mathcal{T})\\) be a topological space with topology \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Then \\(M\\) is called an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold, if the following holds: (TM1): \\(M\\) is Hausdorff. (TM2): The topology of \\(M\\) has a countable basis. (TM3): \\(M\\) is locally homeomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), that is, for all \\(p \\in M\\) exists an open subset \\(U \\subset M\\) with \\(p \\in U\\), an open subset \\(V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and a homeomorphism \\(\\varphi : U \\rightarrow V\\). Figure 2.1: \\(~\\) Remark. The first two conditions in the definition 2.1 are more of a technical nature and are sometimes neglected. The important fact is that a topological manifold is locally homeomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Loosely speaking, manifolds look locally like Euclidean space. If the topology on \\(M\\) is induced by a metric, then the first condition is satisfied automatically. If \\(M\\) is given as a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^N\\) with the subset topology, then both conditions M1 and M2 are satisfied automatically. Let’s see some examples. Example 2.1 Euclidean space \\(M=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) itself is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold: (TM1): We know that \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is metrc space. Let’s say the metric as \\(d\\). Let \\(x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) with \\(x\\neq y\\). Let \\(r=d(x,y)\\). Since \\(x\\neq y\\),\\(r&gt;0\\). Let \\(U_x=B(x,r/2)\\) and \\(U_y=B(y,r/2)\\). So, \\(x\\in U_x\\) and \\(y\\in U_y\\) We need to show that \\(U_x \\cap U_y\\neq \\emptyset\\). We are going to proof by contrdiction. So, asssume the contray, there exist \\(z\\in U_x\\cap U_y\\). Thus, \\(d(x,z)&lt;r/2\\) and \\(d(y,z)&lt;r/2\\). Then, \\[r=d(x,y)\\leq d(x,z)+d(z,y)=d(x,z)+d(y,z)&lt;\\frac{r}{2}+\\frac{r}{2}=r\\] This is contradiction. Hence \\(U_x\\cap U_y \\neq \\emptyset\\). Therefore \\(M=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is Hausdorff. (TM2): Later I will update this part Problem :(. (TM3): Let \\(U=\\mathbb{R}^n=M\\) and \\(V=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(\\varphi=id\\). We can easily tell that idenntity map is bijective. Furthur, we can observe that inverse of identity map is itself and it is well defined. So, Let \\(U&#39;\\subset U=\\mathbb{R}^n\\) be an open set \\[\\forall x\\in U&#39;\\quad id^{-1}(x)=id(x)=x\\]. Thus, \\[id(U&#39;)=id^{-1}(U&#39;)=U&#39;.\\] Hence, by definition of continuous mapping, \\(id\\) and \\(id^{-}\\) are continuous. Example 2.2 Let \\(M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) be an open subset. Then \\(M\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold. (TM1), (TM2) Obvious. (TM3) Holds true with \\(U = M\\), \\(V = M\\) and \\(x = \\text{id}\\). Here Ia m not going to proove this. It is very similar to first example. Example 2.3 The standard sphere \\(M = S^n = \\{ \\underline{y}=(y^0,...,y^{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : ||\\underline{y}|| = 1 \\}\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold. (TM1) and (TM2) , since \\(S^n\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\). (TM3) We construct two homeomorphisms with the help of the stereographic projection. Let \\(N\\) be north pole of the n-sphere, that is \\((\\underbrace{0,...,0}_{n~times},1)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\). Let \\(U_1:=S^n\\setminus \\{N\\}\\) and \\(v_1=\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\). We define \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\varphi:U_1&amp;\\to &amp; V_1\\\\ \\underline{y} =(y^0,y^1,...,y^n) &amp; \\mapsto &amp; \\frac{(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)}{1-y^{n+1}} \\end{eqnarray}\\] - Cliam 1: \\(varphi\\) is injective. Let \\((x^0,...,x^{n}),(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Suppose that \\(\\varphi(x^0,...,x^{n})=\\varphi(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)\\). \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\varphi(x^0,...,x^{n})&amp;=&amp;\\varphi(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)\\\\ \\frac{(x^0,x^1,...,x^n)}{1-x^{n+1}}&amp;=&amp;\\frac{(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)}{1-y^{n+1}}\\\\ (y^0, y^1, ..., y^n)(1-x^{n+1}) &amp;=&amp; (x^0, x^1, ..., x^n)(1-y^{n+1})\\\\ (y^0 - y^0x^{n+1}, y^1 - y^1x^{n+1}, ..., y^n - y^nx^{n+1}) &amp;=&amp; (x^0 - x^0y^{n+1}, x^1 - x^1y^{n+1}, ..., x^n - x^ny^{n+1})\\\\ y^0(1 - x^{n+1}), y^1(1 - x^{n+1}), ..., y^n (1- y^nx^{n+1}) &amp;=&amp; x^0(1-y^{n+1}), x^1(1 - y^{n+1}), ..., x^n (1- y^{n+1})\\\\ \\end{eqnarray}\\] Thus, \\(y^i(1 - x^{n+1}) = x^i(1 -y^{n+1})\\) for all \\(i = 0, 1, ..., n\\). Since \\(1 - y^{n+1}, 1 - x^{n+1} &gt; 0\\), ? ? ? ? Problem HOW INJECTIVITY COMES:(. CHECK:(. - Claim 2: \\(\\varphi\\) is surejctive.  Surjectivity means that for every \\(\\underline{v} \\in V_1 = \\mathbb{R}^n\\), there exists some \\(\\underline{y} \\in U_1\\) such that \\(\\varphi(\\underline{y}) = \\underline{v}\\). So, let \\(\\underline{v} = (v^0, v^1, ..., v^n) \\in V_1\\). We need to find \\(\\underline{y} = (y^0, y^1, ..., y^n) \\in U_1\\) such that \\[\\frac{(y^0, y^1, ..., y^n)}{1-y^{n+1}} = \\underline{v}.\\] We can solve this equation for \\(\\underline{y}\\) as follows: \\[\\underline{y} = (1-y^{n+1})\\underline{v} = \\underline{v} - y^{n+1}\\underline{v}.\\] We know that \\(\\underline{y} \\in U_1 = S^n \\setminus \\{N\\}\\), so \\(y^{n+1} = 1 - \\|\\underline{y}\\|^2\\). Substituting this into the equation gives us \\[\\underline{y} = \\underline{v} - (1 - \\|\\underline{y}\\|^2)\\underline{v} = \\|\\underline{y}\\|^2\\underline{v}.\\] Solving this equation for \\(\\|\\underline{y}\\|^2\\) gives us \\[\\|\\underline{y}\\|^2 = \\frac{\\|\\underline{v}\\|^2}{1 + \\|\\underline{v}\\|^2}.\\] Substituting this back into the equation for \\(\\underline{y}\\) gives us \\[\\underline{y} = \\frac{\\underline{v}}{1 + \\|\\underline{v}\\|^2}.\\] This is a well-defined point in \\(U_1\\) for every \\(\\underline{v} \\in V_1\\), so \\(\\varphi\\) is surjective. Claim: \\(\\varphi\\) is continuous. Note that the inverse map \\(\\phi\\) is given by, \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\phi : V_1 &amp;\\rightarrow &amp; U_1\\\\ \\underline{x}= (x^0, x^1, ... , x^n) &amp;\\mapsto &amp; \\frac{(x^0,x^1,...,x^{n-1})}{1 + x^n} \\end{eqnarray}\\] I will update this proof. I want some to to write rigirs proof:(. Analogously, we define the homeomorphism, which omits the south pole: Let now \\(U_2 := S^n \\setminus \\{S\\}\\) with \\(S := ( 0,... , 0, -1) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\) and \\(V_2 := \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\varphi : U_2 &amp;\\rightarrow &amp; V_2,\\\\ \\underline{y}= (y^0, y^1, ... , y^n) &amp;\\mapsto &amp; \\frac{(y^0,y^1,...,y^n)}{1 + y^n} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Therefore, \\(n\\)-sphere \\(S^n\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional topological manifold. Example 2.4 (Non-Example) We consider \\(M := \\{ (y_1, y_2, y_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 | (y_1)^2 = (y_2)^2 + (y_3)^2 \\}\\), the double cone. Since \\(M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3\\), both (i) and (ii) are satisfied. But \\(M\\) is not a 2-dimensional manifold. Assume it were, then there would exist an open subset \\(U \\subset M\\) with \\(0 \\in U\\), an open subset \\(V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2\\) and a homeomorphism \\(\\varphi : U \\rightarrow V\\) with \\(\\varphi(0) = 0\\). How do we Gruntee that such hormouphsim exsist that maps 0 to 0:( Without losss of generality assume \\(V = B_r(x(0))\\) with \\(r &gt; 0\\). Choose \\(q_1, q_2 \\in U\\) with \\(q_1^1 &gt; 0\\) and \\(q_1^2 &lt; 0\\). Furthermore, choose a continuous path \\(c : [0, 1] \\rightarrow V\\) with \\(c(0) = x(q_1)\\), \\(c(1) = x(q_2)\\) and \\(c(t) \\neq x(0)\\) for all \\(t \\in [0, 1]\\). Define the continuous path \\(\\tilde{c} := x^{-1} \\circ c : [0, 1] \\rightarrow U\\). Then \\(\\tilde{c}(0) = q_1\\), \\(\\tilde{c}(1) = q_2\\), that is, we have \\(\\tilde{c}_1(0) &gt; 0\\) while \\(\\tilde{c}_1(1) &lt; 0\\). Applying the mean value theorem we find, that there exists a \\(t \\in (0, 1)\\) with \\(\\tilde{c}_1(t) = 0\\). Then \\(\\tilde{c}(t) = (0, 0, 0)\\) and consequently \\(c(t) = x(\\tilde{c}(t)) = x(0)\\), which contradicts the choice of \\(c\\). Hence, \\(M\\) is not a 2-dimensional topological manifold.
